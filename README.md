My name is Roksana Sikora and I'm looking for opportunity to work as Junior Software Tester.

I'm working hard to improve my testing skills. I'm extending my knowledge by reading testing books, using online courses and creating my own projects. In this portfolio I would like to present my technical skills.

In this repository I attached my projects where I tried to use my knowledge in practise.
